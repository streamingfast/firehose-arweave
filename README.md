# firehose-arweave

Firehose integration for Arweave.

`firehose-arweave` use [thegarii](https://github.com/ChainSafe/thegarii) as the source
of Arweave blocks.

## Quick Start

> NOTE
>
> this script will install rust and thegarii automatically ( if not exist ).
```
# Arguments shared with both thegarii:
#
# --mindreader-node-start-block-num
# --mindreader-node-stop-block-num
./devel/standard/start.sh -- --mindreader-node-start-block-num 911988
```

## Release

Use the `./bin/release.sh` Bash script to perform a new release. It will ask you questions
as well as driving all the required commands, performing the necessary operation automatically.
The Bash script runs in dry-mode by default, so you can check first that everything is all right.

Releases are performed using [goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/).
